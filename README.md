In, this project I have just created a "Password Complexity Checker" that user can verify the password if it is strong or weak according to user password.

A Password Complexity Checker is a tool designed to evaluate the strength and security of a password based on specific criteria. Its main purpose is to ensure that passwords are difficult for attackers to guess or crack, enhancing overall security.

Key Features:
1)Length Validation

*Checks if the password meets a minimum length requirement (e.g., 8 or more characters).

2)Character Variety Check:

*Evaluates the use of different character types:

*Uppercase letters (A–Z)

*Lowercase letters (a–z)

*Numbers (0–9)

*Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $)

3) Dictionary Word Detection:

*Identifies and flags passwords containing common words or patterns found in dictionaries, reducing vulnerability to dictionary attacks.

4)Repetition and Sequence Detection:

*Detects repeated characters or sequential patterns (e.g., "12345", "aaaa", "abcde").

5)Real-time Feedback:

*Provides users with instant suggestions or strength meters while creating or updating a password.

6)Customizable Rules:

*Allows administrators to define and adjust complexity requirements based on policy or application needs.

7)Password Strength Scoring:

*Assigns a score (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong) based on the overall complexity.

These features help enforce strong password policies, reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to weak or predictable credentials which user can find the right way to implement them in various website for signing up the website using the registered email with their password.
